The girl clawed at Brecken's face as he raised the metal bar ...</div>






<div class="block1">Social living requires the elimination, or at very best, the modification of many elements
necessary to survival in "nature". And when an emergency arises, very often it is
the person who would be considered a "criminal", in other situations, who alone is
able to cope with the necessities. If we manage to eliminate "violence" from human
affairs, what will we find when a need for "violence" arises&mdash;a need outside of man's
artificial control of his environment?</div>

<h2>By H. B. Fyfe</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lou Phillips</span> sat on the cold
metal deck of the control room,
seething with a growing dislike
for the old man.</p>

<p>"What you are here for," the other
had told him when the guards had
brought Phillips in, "is a simple crime
of violence. You'll do, I'm sure."</p>

<p>The old man paced the deck impatiently,
while a pair of armed guards
maintained a watchful silence by the
door. Two more men in plain gray
shirts and trousers sat beside Phillips,
leaning back sullenly against the
bulkhead. He guessed that they were
waiting for a fourth, remembering that
three other figures had been hustled
aboard with him at the Lunar spaceport.</p>

<p>The door slid open, allowing another
youth in gray uniform to stumble
inside. One of the guards in the corridor
beyond shoved the newcomer
forward, and Phillips' eyebrows
twitched as he had a closer look. This
last prisoner was a girl.</p>

<p>He thought she might have been
pretty, with a touch of lipstick and a
kinder arrangement of her short, ash-blonde
hair; but he lowered his eyes
as her hard, wary stare flickered past
him. She walked over to the bulkhead
and took a seat at the other end of
the little group.</p>

<p>The old man turned, scanning their
faces critically. "I am in charge of a
peculiar project," he announced
abruptly. "The director of the Lunar
Detention Colony claims that you four
are the best he has&mdash;<i>for our purposes</i>!"</p>

<p>Long habit kept the seated ones
guardedly silent. Seeing, apparently,
that they would not relax, he continued.</p>

<p>"You were chosen because each of
you has received a sentence of detention
for life because of tendencies toward
violence in one form or another.
In our twenty-second century civilization
such homicidal inclinations are
quite rare, due to the law-abiding
habits of generations under the Interplanetary
Council."</p>

<p>He had been pacing the cramped
space left free by the equipment, the
guards, and the four seated prisoners.
Now he paused, as if mildly astonished
at what he was about to say.</p>

<p>"In fact, now that we are faced by
a situation demanding illegal violence,
it appears that no <i>normal</i> citizen is
capable of committing such an act.
Using you may eliminate costly
screening processes ... <i>and save time</i>.
Incidentally, I am Anthony Varret,
Undersecretary for Security in the
Council."</p>

<p>None of the four showed any overt
sign of being impressed. Phillips
knew that the others, like himself,
were scrutinizing the old man with
cold, secretive stares. They had
learned through harsh experience to
keep their own counsels. Varret
shrugged. "Well, then," he said dryly,
"I might as well call the roll. I have
been supplied with accurate records."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He drew a notebook</span>
from his pocket, consulted it
briefly, then nodded at the man next
to the girl. "Robert Brecken," he recited,
"age thirty-one, six feet, one
hundred eighty-five pounds, hair reddish
brown, eyes green, complexion
ruddy. Convicted of unjustified homicide
by personal assault while resisting
arrest for embezzlement. Detention
record unsatisfactory. Implicated
in two minor mutinies."</p>

<p>He glanced next at the youth beside
Phillips. "Raymond Truesdale, age
twenty-two, five-feet-five, one-thirty.
Hair black, eyes dark brown, complexion
pale. Convicted of two suicide
attempts following failures in various
artistic fields. Detention record fair,
psychological report poor."</p>

<p>His frosty eyes met Phillips'.
"Louis Phillips, age twenty-six, five-ten,
one-eighty. Hair brown, eyes
brown, complexion darkly tanned&mdash;that
was before Luna, wasn't it,
Phillips? Convicted of unjustified
homicide, having assaulted a jet
mechanic so as to cause death. Detention
record satisfactory."</p>

<p>The blonde girl was last in Varret's
review. "Donna Bailey, age twenty-three,
five-five, one-fifteen. Hair
blonde, eyes blue, complexion fair.
Convicted of manslaughter by negligence,
while piloting an atmosphere
sport rocket in an intoxicated condition.
Detention record satisfactory."</p>

<p>Varret fell silent, regarding them
with cynical disgust. His lips twisted
slightly with distaste. "There we have
it," he said. "A violent-tempered thief
from the business world; an over-expensive
purchase by a rich playboy
who became his widow by her own
negligence; a mentally-unstable fool
who thought he was artistically gifted,
and a rocket engineer who was
too brutally careless with his own
strength when irritated by a space-fatigued
helper. I wonder if you'll
do...?"</p>

<p>Phillips felt impelled at last to
speak. "Just what plans do you have
for us?" he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>"Nothing complicated," replied Varret,
matching the tone. "We need you
to perform a mass murder!"</p>

<p>Phillips blinked, despite his prison-learned
reserve. He heard the girl
suck in her breath sharply, and felt
the youth beside him begin to tremble.</p>

<p>"I have shocked you, I see,"
sneered Varret. "Well, I assure you,
it shocks me also, probably a good
deal more since I have lived a normal
life. However&mdash;this is the background:</p>

<p>"About three months ago, we had
reports of the outbreak of a deadly
plague in one of the asteroid groups.
As near as can be determined, it was
spread by the crew of an exploratory
rocket after the discovery of a new
asteroid. It began to sweep through
the mining colonies out there with the
velocity of an expanding nova!"</p>

<p>"Where was your Health Department?"
asked the man named Brecken
in a sneering tone.</p>

<p>Varret frowned at him. "Several
members gave their lives trying to
learn the nature of the disease. We
have no information to date, except
a theory that it attacks the nervous
and circulatory systems, because the
reports indicate that the reason of the
victim is markedly affected as the
disease progresses. Not a single survivor
is known&mdash;they all die in raving
insanity. We do not even know with
certainty how it is communicated."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked
Phillips.</p>

<p>"Isolation. It is all we <i>can</i> do, until
our medical men can make some
progress. We evacuated an asteroid
colony and began to ship into it any
person showing any of the symptoms,
using a cruiser piloted by remote control.
That was where we slipped."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"On the last trip&mdash;unless we have
not really collected <i>all</i> the sufferers&mdash;we
lost control. Someone being
transported knew his spaceships.
Shortly thereafter, a gibbering lunatic
got on the screen and threatened the
escorting rocket. He announced the
cruiser would head for Mars, where
the passengers would demand their
freedom. They are past reasoning
with."</p>

<p>"Can't say I really blame them,"
Phillips remarked.</p>

<p>"Blame them? Of course not!
Neither do I. What has that to do
with it? What has the Council so
worried is that this thing will get
loose on Mars, that it may even be
carried to Earth and Venus. There
are over a hundred persons in that
ship, no longer responsible for their
actions but capable of causing deaths
by the billions. We <i>want</i> to help
them, but we simply must hold the
line on this quarantine until we solve
the medical problem."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They stared at him in</span>
silence, and Phillips noticed
that the old man's forehead was moist
with tiny beads of perspiration.</p>

<p>"Don't you see? They are as good
as dead. No knowledge or help of man
can save them&mdash;as of this moment. If
we are <i>ever</i> to be of any help, we
must prevent a worse catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Yes, the survival ship is a world
in itself, but this world must die!"</p>

<p>For a minute or two, it seemed to
Phillips that he could hear each person
in the control room breathing.
Finally, there was a small sound of
cloth rubbing on metal as Brecken
stirred. "Why pick on us?" he rasped
from his seat on the deck. "I'm no
volunteer!"</p>

<p>"I know what you are," replied
Varret sharply. "I know what you all
are. You have been chosen for this
mission of murder, because you are
the only people in our culture who
are capable of this kind of violence.
You have broken our laws, and this
is your punishment.</p>

<p>"It would take us too long to find
others like you who had merely never
faced the same circumstances that
sent you four to Luna. We have made
attempts to attack this vessel. Manned
by normal men, our ships could accomplish
nothing."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Phillips.</p>

<p>"<i>The crews found they could not
kill!</i>"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It amounts to that. One pilot
blacked out at the start of an offensive
approach. He lost contact before
recovering&mdash;you realize how quickly
that happens at interplanetary speeds.
On several other ships, there were
passive mutinies. One was destroyed;
how, we do not know."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get some <i>men</i> in
your Department of Security?"
sneered Brecken.</p>

<p>Varret sighed. "It was far from
simple cowardice. The crews had fine
records. We have been civilized too
long, so long that the idea of deliberate
killing unnerved them. As to the
one ship that did make some motion
to attack, it may have been destroyed
by the cruiser's defenses, or even by
sabotage. Somebody may quite possibly
have found the mission too repulsive
to face with complete sanity."</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a uniformed
man, who slid the door open and gestured
significantly. Varret paused. He
nodded, and the newcomer retired.</p>

<p>"I have only a few minutes," said
the old man, facing them again. "To
be brief, this patrol vessel is armed
with the best we have in guided atomic
missiles and sensitive detection devices.
Technical manuals are supplied
for everything we could think of,
though I doubt you will need them.
We have brought you to within a
few hundred miles of <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes, my men and I
will transfer to an escort ship. We
will slip in behind Deimos, not too far
away, and pick you up afterward to
land you on Mars. Any questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phillips.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why should we do anything at
all?"</p>

<p>Varret's lips tightened. A guard
shrugged contemptuously. "I was told
to expect that attitude," the old man
admitted. "I suppose it is part of
the character we now think is needed
for such an expedition."</p>

<p>"You could hardly expect co-operation,"
Phillips pointed out. "Laws
against any kind of homicide are all
well enough, but I for one don't see
why I should draw the same sentence
as a murderer. I had to protect myself
or die&mdash;probably through having
that crazy fool blow up my rocket
room."</p>

<p>"You'll make a cold landing on Sol
before you'll get any help from me!"
Brecken added defiantly.</p>

<p>The girl said nothing, but Truesdale
muttered darkly.</p>

<p>"Please!" said Varret. "I have no
time to argue about our social and
legal codes. The Council foresaw that
the threat of being yourselves subject
to this plague might not be
enough. If you succeed in destroying
or even immobilizing the cruiser, I
can offer you anything you want
short of unsupervised liberty. You
must still be watched as potential
dangers to society, but you may otherwise
be as wealthy or independent as
you wish."</p>

<p>He motioned to the guards, who had
begun to fidget impatiently; wordlessly
they left the compartment.</p>

<p>"You can settle your relations
among yourselves," said Varret. "We
chose Bailey partly because she has
piloted rockets privately, and Phillips
because he was a space engineer. Perhaps
Brecken could handle the torpedoes&mdash;I
do not know." He rubbed
his chin uneasily. "Frankly, I find
intimate discussion of the affair repulsive.
I hope you will decide to
do what is necessary for the welfare
of Earth."</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and left the
control room. They heard distant
voices exhorting him to hurry.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Brecken</span> arose and crept furtively to
the door. He leaned
out to peer down the corridor.
The nervous Truesdale bounced up to
crowd behind him. Phillips and the
girl looked at each other; she
shrugged, and they too got to their
feet. She turned to the instrument
panels; and after a moment, Phillips
joined her.</p>

<p>"How have they got it?" he asked.
"Controls locked?"</p>

<p>"No," murmured Donna. "Don't
need to; we're just coasting. Nice
job, though. Fast as a racer, I imagine."</p>

<p>"You know something about
racers?"</p>

<p>"I used to think I did," she answered,
shortly.</p>

<p>He saw pain darken her blue eyes
and decided to probe no further. Instead,
he wandered about, inspecting
the instruments. A few minutes later,
with a spaceman's indefinable alertness,
he felt a change in the ship.</p>

<p>"They still aboard?" he called to
Truesdale, who remained at the door
although Brecken had disappeared.</p>

<p>The youth glanced over his shoulder
but did not trouble to reply.
Phillips' jaw set, and he took a quick
step toward the other. Before he
reached the doorway, however, Brecken
returned from the corridor. Shouldering
Truesdale aside, he strode into
the control room. "Well," he announced,
"the old fool hopped off
like he said. Got a viewer in here?"</p>

<p>"I have it on now," called Donna
from the instrument desk. "There he
goes."</p>

<p>They gathered around the screen
to watch. Near one edge was the image
of another ship, with several
spacesuited figures clustered around
its entrance port. The girl made an
adjustment, and the view crept over
to the center of the screen just as the
last of the figures vanished into the
opening. Almost immediately, the
other rocket slanted away on a new
course.</p>

<p>Donna followed it on the screen
until the brief flashes of its jets were
dimmed by a new radiance&mdash;the ruddy
disk of Mars. "We <i>are</i> where he
said," she admitted. "Now what?"</p>

<p>She looked at Phillips, who merely
shrugged. "What do you make of
it?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Pretty much as he said, probably,"
answered the engineer. "He's heading
for Deimos, I suppose. I hear they're
landscaping the whole moon&mdash;it's
only about five miles in diameter&mdash;and
building a new space station for
a radio beacon and relay."</p>

<p>"Does that log say anything about
the plague ship?" asked Truesdale
nervously.</p>

<p>Donna scanned the observation record,
then adjusted the viewer. The
red radiance of Mars fled, to be replaced
by a dimmer scene of distant
stars.</p>

<p>"In there someplace," she said.
"Out of range of this screen, but we
could probably locate it with detector
instruments."</p>

<p>"Why all the jabber?" demanded
Brecken. "Let's get going!"</p>

<p>Phillips stared at him. "What's the
rush? Did he sell you that easily?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, hell, no! I mean let's
make a dive for Mars. They were
dumb to set us loose with a fast ship.
We're dumber if we don't use it!"</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Truesdale
eagerly. "We don't owe them anything.
They owe us; for the years
they took out of our lives!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Truesdale had a point</span>
there, Phillips felt. This could
grow into quite a discussion, and he
was not sure which side he wanted
to take. He had no great urge to become
a hero, but on the other hand
there was something about Brecken
that aroused a certain obstinacy in
him.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Donna protested;
"what do you think you're going to
do?"</p>

<p>"Slip into a curve for Mars," said
Brecken. "Slow down enough to take
to chutes an' let this can smack up
in the deserts somewhere. They'll
never know if we got out, an' we'll
be on our own."</p>

<p>The girl turned to Phillips. "How
about you?" she asked. "Don't you
think we should at least consider what
Varret told us? If this plague is as
dangerous as he says, this is no time
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you <i>have</i> to be so bloodthirsty?"
complained Truesdale.</p>

<p>"I don't want to kill anybody," declared
the girl; "maybe we could just
disable the cruiser."</p>

<p>"Aw, kill your jets!" Brecken broke
in. "I've been waiting for a chance
like this for years. Don't get any
ideas!"</p>

<p>"But listen!" pleaded Donna. "It's
a terrible thing, but if we don't do
it, we won't be safe on Mars ourselves;
they'll land and set an epidemic
loose."</p>

<p>"I'll take my chances with it," said
Brecken. "You're supposed to know
something about piloting. Now get
us on a curve for Mars, an' be snappy
about it!"</p>

<p>Donna turned desperately to Phillips.</p>

<p>"Why not look over the ship," the
engineer suggested, "before we blast
off on half our jets? We can make
up our minds when we see what we
have for fuel and weapons."</p>

<p>Brecken opened his mouth to object,
but was smitten by an unpleasant
thought. "Suppose they didn't
leave us enough fuel to make Mars!"</p>

<p>"We can find out soon enough,"
said Phillips, leading the way to the
door.</p>

<p>They trooped down the corridor on
his heels, past the few closet-like
compartments set aside for living
quarters. It was a single-deck ship,
with storage compartments above and
below for fuel, oxygen, and other
necessities. The corridor was liberally
supplied with handrails, apparently in
case of failure of the artificial gravity
system.</p>

<p>About halfway to the end, another
passage crossed the fore-and-aft one,
and a few steps farther was a ladder.
This extended up and down a vertical
well, which in space amounted to
a second cross corridor. Phillips was
right when he guessed that the door
beyond opened into the rocket room.</p>

<p>The others were bored by the power
plant of the ship. The engineer,
however, could not repress a thrill at
once more standing surrounded by
the gauges, valves, and pumps with
which he had formerly lived. He
strode about, examining and comprehending
such appliances as seemed
new since his last service in space.</p>

<p>"How about it?" demanded Brecken.
"Can you handle it?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Phillips confidently.
"Mostly automatic anyway."</p>

<p>"Then we can get movin' whenever
we want?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. The tanks are nearly
full; let's find those space torpedoes
the old man mentioned."</p>

<p>"Maybe it won't hurt, at that,"
grumbled Brecken.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He led the way out, but</span>
paused indecisively. Phillips
stepped past him and considered the
cross passages near the midpoint of
the corridor. Those in the plane of
the control room deck probably led to
port and starboard airlocks, he reasoned,
so the others might lead to the
torpedo turrets.</p>

<p>He went to the vertical well and
started up the ladder, hearing the
others follow. At the top, he was confronted
by a hatch with a red danger
sign. Glancing about, he located the
gauges that reported the air pressure
beyond. Normal.</p>

<p>"Make a little room," he said, looking
down to Brecken.</p>

<p>The big, ruddy face retreated a
few rungs. Phillips could hear the
others scrambling further down. He
got his head out of the way before
pulling the switch that opened the
hatch. With a subdued humming of
electric motors, the massively constructed
door swung down. One after
another, they pulled themselves up
into the compartment.</p>

<p>"This must be where they set controls
for launching," guessed Phillips,
leaning back against a rack of emergency
spacesuits. "That intercom
screen on the bulkhead is probably
plugged in to the control room. Looks
as if the torpedoes themselves are
stored under that hatch at the after
end."</p>

<p>"How do they kick them off?"
asked Brecken.</p>

<p>"Those conveyor belts run them
into tubes in the forward bulkhead.
A charge of compressed air blows
them out, and then the rockets are
started and controlled by radio."</p>

<p>"You mean we have to point at a
target to fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Once the rockets are going,
the torpedo can be maneuvered
and aimed anywhere by remote control."</p>

<p>"I've seen enough," announced
Truesdale. "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>At that, they all decided to return
to the main deck. Phillips carefully
closed the airtight hatch as they left,
then followed the others in search of
the galley.</p>

<p>Later, after a very unsatisfactory
meal of packaged concentrates, they
loitered sullenly in the control room
once more while Donna studied the
controls. Phillips had finally decided
that he could wear the third spacesuit
on the rack if he had to. He was
idly examining the tools supplied with
it when his thoughts were interrupted.</p>

<p>Young Truesdale had been monkeying
with a range indicator for some
time, but now his sharp outcry drew
all eyes to him.</p>

<p>The others immediately gathered to
peer over his shoulder. A needle flickered
wildly from one side of the dial
to the other.</p>

<p>"Here! Get it balanced," said
Phillips, thrusting a powerful arm between
the crowded bodies. As his deft
adjustment steadied the needle, he
stepped back and leaned against the
bulkhead to study their faces. Truesdale's
was pale.</p>

<p>"It's them!" he panted.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Donna, "what will it
be?"</p>

<p>"Whaddya mean?" demanded
Brecken, red-faced. "It'll be get dam'
well outa here, that's what it'll be!"</p>

<p>"Let's see you go," invited the girl
coolly. "How well do <i>you</i> pilot a
rocket?"</p>

<p>Brecken's jaw dropped. "Wh-wh-what?
You crazy? Did you swallow
all that stuff the old man told you?"
he sputtered.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Donna. "They
didn't bring us all the way out here
for nothing. Varret was scared. If
it's that dangerous, somebody just has
to do it&mdash;and we're here!"</p>

<p>"Not for long," said Brecken in an
ugly tone. "Get hot on those controls.
You, Phillips! Run back to that rocket
room and see that things work!"</p>

<p>"You try it," suggested the engineer
quietly.</p>

<p>He would have preferred to avoid
the trouble the girl had been stirring
up, but he did not relish Brecken's
tone. A few days off Luna, he reflected,
and already he was getting
independent.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Donna, encouraged
in her defiance, "when I touch those
controls, we'll go right up and touch
noses with them. You'd better have
a torpedo ready!"</p>

<p>She turned to the banks of buttons
and switches. Muffled thunder from
the stern jets trembled through the
hull as the men staggered.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Brecken</span> recovered his balance
first. With a snarl, he grabbed
the girl by the nape of the neck
and shook her roughly. Glimpsing
Phillips' cold sneer, he reached back
and seized a heavy metal bar from the
spacesuit rack.</p>

<p>"Now, dammit!" he grated. "You'll
do like I tell you! And <i>you</i> get back
there an' see that those tubes recharge
okay!"</p>

<p>Phillips felt a hard anger swelling
his throat. From the corner of his
eye, he saw Truesdale shrinking back
against the bulkhead. He glanced
about desperately for something with
which to parry Brecken's bar.</p>

<p>It was the girl who broke the tense
silence. With a gasping intake of
breath, she reached up to claw at
Brecken's face. Cursing, the man
twisted his head away to protect his
eyes. He released his grip on the girl's
neck and swung a clumsy, backhand
blow at her head. Donna stumbled,
and collapsed to the deck.</p>

<p><i>Now or never</i>, Phillips told himself.
Without waiting to think, he
hurled himself forward.</p>

<p>Brecken saw him coming, and tried
to shift around to meet the engineer's
charge. Phillips crashed into him
shoulder first, and they both brought
up against the opposite bulkhead with
a thud. He concentrated all his
strength into wringing the other's
forearm until he heard the bar clang
to the deck.</p>

<p>Brecken clubbed him on the side of
the head with a wild left swing, and
Phillips found the big man's foot in
the way when he tried to sidestep. He
lost his balance, but kept his grasp
on the other so that they went down
together, thrashing about for some
opening. Brecken was red-faced with
a maniacal rage. Beads of saliva
sprayed from his twisted lips as he
sputtered curses.</p>

<p>The engineer let go suddenly and
jolted the other under the chin with
the heel of his left hand. The man
arched backward, but Phillips caught
a knee in the chest that sent him
slithering across the deck. As he
strove to twist to his hands and
knees, he saw Brecken groping for
the bar.</p>

<p><i>Never reach him</i>, thought Phillips
frantically.</p>

<p>Thrusting one foot against the leg
of an anchored data desk, he raised
himself half upright as he lunged desperately
at Brecken. Strangely, it occurred
to Phillips for a fleeting lapse
of time that old Varret had been reasonably
astute in his selections, if he
desired violent-tempered throwbacks.
Then the breath was knocked out of
him as he smashed into Brecken with
a force that sent them both hurtling
into the bulkhead.</p>

<p>The other's grunt of pain was almost
lost beneath the sharp smack of
bone against metal. Phillips scrambled
up hastily, but his opponent lay still.</p>

<p>Over by the data desk, Donna was
beginning to squirm quietly and make
groping motions with her outstretched
hands. Truesdale had retreated to the
forward end of the control room, his
features blanched by apprehension.</p>

<p><i>I'll bet</i>, thought Phillips, <i>that old
Varret slipped up in your case, my lad.
Your reaction to violence must be
what they call normal</i>.</p>

<p>He beckoned brusquely. "Give me
a hand with him," he ordered.</p>

<p>Brecken still showed no sign of
consciousness. Truesdale approached
warily, and with his aid Phillips lifted
the unconscious man. With their burden
limp in their hands, they staggered
down the corridor to one of the
sleeping compartments. There, they
slung him into a bunk.</p>

<p>"He needs attention," said Truesdale.</p>

<p>"He won't get it from me," snapped
Phillips. "Lumps on the head were
his idea; there's no time to fool with
him."</p>

<p>He pulled the sliding door shut, noticing
that it had no lock. Since Brecken
would probably be some time recovering,
however, he put that out of
his mind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Having returned to the</span>
control room, they discovered
Donna sitting up. At the sight of them,
she pulled herself somewhat shakily
to a standing position, and brushed
back her blonde hair.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He bumped his head on the bulkhead,"
said Phillips shortly.</p>

<p>This was accepted without comment.
They turned to the instruments and
examined the dial of the range indicator.</p>

<p>"They aren't very far away," said
Donna quietly. "Where do you stand
now, Phillips?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we'd better do it," he
admitted. "Pretty vicious, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No!" she snapped. "I don't like
it either; I've never caused the death
of any human being."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure. That's why you were on
Luna!"</p>

<p>She looked at him levelly in the eye,
but her shoulders drooped a trifle with
the resignation of one who has often
been disbelieved.</p>

<p>"My husband was a nice guy," she
murmured, "but he never did know
when he had a drink too many for
piloting his jet. He passed out trying
to give me a wild ride, and I got to
the controls just in time to crash-land
the rocket; that's where they found
me before I came to."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Phillips.</p>

<p>"I'm not half as hard as I'm trying
to pretend," Donna went on, "even
after a year on Luna. But I was a
nurse before I was married. I'm thinking
about what it will be like if this
plague hits the planets before they
find something to fight it with. The
children ... imagine that, will you?"</p>

<p>Phillips stared at the range indicator.
It seemed there were times when an
ugly thing had to be done for the
common good. He wondered how the
old-time executioners had felt, in the
days when there had been judicial
homicide. There were still jailers, for
that matter, and men who butchered
cattle.</p>

<p>"Call it a mercy killing," murmured
Donna between pale lips. "Maybe you
think <i>that</i> isn't still done once in a
while, in spite of modern society."</p>

<p>"Ummh," Phillips grunted. "Well, if
you can watch at this end, Truesdale
and I can go set up a couple of torpedoes.
I hope those rocket blasts
didn't give us away."</p>

<p>"According to Varret," said Truesdale,
"there can't be many of them
still able to think straight enough to
stand on watch. I wonder what it's
like...."</p>

<p>Phillips glanced askance at him, but
led the way into the corridor. First of
all, he stopped at the rocket room to
check the tube readings. The fired jets
had been automatically recharged.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They left the rocket</span>
room and climbed the ladder
to the turret. Once inside, Phillips
spent the first few minutes inspecting
the equipment and thumbing through
the manuals left there by Varret. Finally,
the bored Truesdale broke in
upon his study.</p>

<p>"That old goat must be crazy to
think he could toss us out here and
have us act like a trained crew. How
can we even hope to do anything right,
without blowing ourselves up?"</p>

<p>"We can try," said Phillips coldly.
"It shouldn't be impossible to get one
started, at least."</p>

<p>He found the twin control panels
in the bulkhead, and pulled a pair of
switches. There was a smooth humming
and a slight click as two hatches
in the deck slid open. Slanting metal
chutes rose out of the dark apertures,
just behind the conveyor belts.</p>

<p>"Look at those babies!" breathed
Phillips.</p>

<p>The snouts of two miniature spaceships
protruded from the storage hold.
Phillips touched other switches, and
the sleek missiles were prodded onto
the belts and moved forward until the
full, twenty-foot lengths were in view.</p>

<p>"Phillips, you better be careful with
those things!" quavered Truesdale as
the engineer unscrewed a small hatch
on one.</p>

<p>"Afraid I'll blow it up?" asked Phillips,
peering inside.</p>

<p>"Why not? You never touched one
before."</p>

<p>"You go ahead and believe that,"
retorted the engineer. "Now, I'll just
turn on the radio controls, check the
batteries, and feed the bad news into
the launching tubes. Watch!"</p>

<p>Replacing the hatch and securing
it, he thought out the procedure to use
at the remote control panels. Turning
on the screen above one of them produced
a cross-haired image of the bulkhead
directly in front of the near torpedo.
He tried various manipulations
until he had focused the view and
caused it to sweep all around the interior
of the turret. After idly watching
himself and Truesdale appear on
the screen, he returned the view to
dead ahead, switched it off, and turned
to the other panel.</p>

<p>"I guess I can finish checking," he
said.</p>

<p>Truesdale clambered hastily down
the ladder. Phillips shook his head.
"Don't know what use he'll be," he
muttered. "Too bad Brecken wouldn't
listen. He at least ... oh, well!"</p>

<p>He wondered whether he himself
would stand up when the time came.
What Varret had asked did not sound
like much. Just a quick shot and
watch them blow apart. What inhibitions
made men black out rather than
carry it through? It was not as if
there were any hope for these people.
Surely, it was obvious that to permit
them, in their deranged state, to spread
a catastrophic plague was inconceivable.
But perhaps emotions were
stronger than reason.</p>

<p>"I'll find out pretty soon," he reflected.</p>

<p>There was little more to do in the
turret, except to run the torpedoes
into the launching tubes and bring up
a new pair in reserve. With that much
done, he closed the hatch and climbed
down the ladder.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In the control room, he</span>
found Donna and Truesdale
peering into the screen. He crowded
close to look over their shoulders. A
small blob of light floated near the
center of the view. "That it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Donna. "Just
enough Mars-light to show it."</p>

<p>"How near are we?" asked Phillips.</p>

<p>"About a hundred and fifty miles.
I have quite a large magnification, but
they may spot us if they're alert. Are
you ready to ... do something?"</p>

<p>"Reasonably," said Phillips.
"Where's Brecken?"</p>

<p>"You probably <i>killed</i> him!" Truesdale
broke in accusingly.</p>

<p>"I found a first-aid kit and gave
him a shot," said Donna. "He has a
nasty lump on the head, but he might
sleep it off."</p>

<p>Phillips was watching Truesdale.
The youth was visibly nervous. Was
it the thought of Brecken, the engineer
wondered, or fear of what they were
planning to do? Perhaps it would be
best to clear the air now, before it was
too late.</p>

<p>"I guess you can handle it here,
Donna," he said. "Truesdale and I will
go to the turret and stand by."</p>

<p>The youth shrank away. "No! I
won't go up there again! You can't
make me do this!"</p>

<p>"Do what?" demanded Phillips.</p>

<p>"It's <i>murder</i>! You both know it is!
They won't even have any warning."</p>

<p>"I <i>hope</i> not," said Phillips drily.
"They might get <i>us</i>!"</p>

<p>"You <i>would</i> put it that way,"
sneered Truesdale; "you're homicidal
at heart anyway!" He turned on
Donna, wiping perspiration from his
forehead. "Are you going to let him
do it?" he shrilled. "Are you going to
help him commit such a crime?"</p>

<p>The girl stared at him with a worried
look in her blue eyes but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Come on, Truesdale," said Phillips,
making an effort at a peaceful,
persuasive tone. "It will be either
their lives or ours if they spot us&mdash;and
millions more if they get by.
They'll be too desperate to think of
us. Do you want to die?"</p>

<p>The instant he spoke the last words,
he remembered the other's record and
wished he had kept quiet. He saw, a
strange, wild expression creep over
Truesdale's features. It changed into
a look of hateful cunning as the youth,
began to sidle toward the door.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> not afraid to die!" he boasted
in a low-pitched but tense voice. "But
how about you, Phillips? How about
the big, brutal space engineer who is
proud of smashing men's skulls against
steel walls, who would like nothing
better than to blow up a shipload of
innocent people. How do you really
know they're dangerous? But you
don't care, do you?"</p>

<p>"Truesdale!" snapped Phillips.
"Calm down!"</p>

<p>"I'll calm you down with me!"
shouted the other hysterically. "I'll
<i>show</i> you who's afraid to die!"</p>

<p>He ducked through the door toward
which he had been backing. Phillips
lunged after him, just barely missing
a grip.</p>

<p>"On your toes!" he shouted over
his shoulder to Donna, and turned on
all jets.</p>

<p>But Truesdale, driven by his peculiar
fury, not only stayed ahead as
they raced along the corridor, but actually
gained.</p>

<p>He was fifteen or twenty feet out
in front as they reached the midway
point. Phillips, expecting him to take
refuge in the rocket room, was completely
fooled when Truesdale leaped
for the ladder in the vertical well. He
stumbled, and grabbed a handrail to
stop himself. The other was swarming
upward. Phillips sprang to follow.</p>

<p>Hardly had he climbed half a dozen
rungs, however, than he saw he was
outdistanced. Truesdale's feet were already
disappearing beyond the hatchway.
Phillips waited for the airtight
door to slam shut. It remained open....</p>

<p>Then a thrill of instinctive fear shot
through him as he thought of what
Truesdale might do&mdash;probably was
<i>doing</i> at that very instant!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="190" height="86" alt="2" title="2" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Throwing</span> his feet clear of the
rungs, he plunged back toward
the deck, guided only by his
hands brushing the sides of the ladder.
As Phillips reached the junction
of the passages, he kicked desperately
away from the ladder. He landed with
a thump that would have hurt had he
been in a calmer state.</p>

<p>Rolling over toward the control
room, he came to his feet in time to
glimpse Donna looking out the doorway
before a jarring shock floored
him again.</p>

<p>The deafening roar of an explosion
resounded in the corridor as a brilliant
light was luridly reflected from somewhere
behind him. The bewildering
force hurled him at the deck; he saw
he could not prevent his head from
striking&mdash;</p>

<p>Phillips found himself on hands and
knees, staring stupidly at the deck a
few inches past his nose. As in a nightmare,
he seemed to spend an eternity
pushing himself painfully to his feet.
Clutching a handrail, he finally made
it.</p>

<p>He saw Donna kneeling in the doorway,
hand to head. As he watched, the
girl looked at her hand, and dazedly
pulled out a handkerchief to wipe off
the blood.</p>

<p>Then Phillips became aware of a
high breeze in his face. Behind him,
the sound of rushing air rose to a
moan, then to a shriek. That shocked
him to his senses.</p>

<p>"<i>Button up!</i>" he screamed above
the noise, bringing his hands together
in an urgent gesture understood by all
spacemen.</p>

<p>As the girl staggered to her feet,
he whirled and leaped toward the junction
of the cross corridors. He wasted
no time in a vain glance upwards&mdash;he
knew what Truesdale had done. Only
setting off the torpedoes' rockets in
the enclosed turret compartment would
have caused an explosion just severe
enough to rupture the ship's skin; if
the warheads had gone off, he never
would have known it.</p>

<p>Diving headlong through the opening
in the deck, he experienced a dizzying
shift of gravity as he passed
through the plane of the main deck.
When he had his bearings again, he
scrambled "up" the ladder toward the
belly turret. By the time he got the
airtight hatch open, he was beginning
to pant in the thinning air. He pulled
himself through at last, and sealed the
compartment.</p>

<p>Phillips sucked in a deep, luxurious
breath while he glanced about. This
turret, he saw, was a duplicate of the
other. He immediately located the intercom
screen and called the control
room. Donna's worried face appeared.
"Where are you?" was her relieved
inquiry.</p>

<p>Phillips explained what had happened.
"The only thing," he concluded,
"is to try it from here."</p>

<p>"I think they must have spotted
the flash," Donna told him. "The instruments
show a shift in their
course."</p>

<p>"Blast right at them!" said Phillips.
"We might get away with it if
we're quick."</p>

<p>He turned away, leaving the intercom
on. A few quick steps took him
to the control panels in the bulkhead.
Guided by his lessons in the other
turret, and by faded memories of space
school on Earth, he brought up two
of the torpedoes. He checked the radio
controls and ran the missiles into their
launching tubes. As he worked, with
nervous sweat running down into his
eyes, he was aware of the intermittent
jar of rocket blasts.</p>

<p>"Run 'em down!" he muttered, trying
to steady his hand on the controls.</p>

<p>He had a hand at each panel, with
the torpedoes poised viciously in the
tubes, when he heard Donna's shout,
shrill with excitement, over the intercom.</p>

<p>Instantly, he launched the missiles.
He started the rockets by remote control,
and scanned the screens for a
sight of the other vessel.</p>

<p>For a moment, his view was confused
by the expanding puff of air;
then that froze, and drifted back to
the hull, and he could see the stars.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Donna's voice, strained</span>
but coldly controlled, came
over the intercom with readings from
her instruments. He corrected his
courses accordingly.</p>

<p>Then he saw the image of their
target centered on one screen, so he
concentrated on steering the other
missile. He made the nose yaw, but
was unable to locate anything on its
screen.</p>

<p>"You're sending one of them too far
above, I think," Donna reported.</p>

<p>"I have something wrong," he shouted.
"I can't spot them at all for that
one. The jets must be out of line and
shooting it in a curve."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he fired a corrective
blast on the weight of the guess, before
returning his attention to the first
torpedo.</p>

<p>This one was right on the curve. He
could see the massive hull of the
cruiser plainly now. It was almost featureless
until, as he watched, several
sections seemed to slide aside.</p>

<p>The screen showed him a momentary
glimpse of a swarm of small,
flame-tailed objects spewing forth
from one of the openings. Then the
view went dark. "Interceptor rockets
with proximity fuses," he muttered.
"They'll be after us next, crazy-mean
and frantic!"</p>

<p>Over the intercom, he heard Donna
exclaim in dismay. He caught a fleeting
sight of her face and realized that
the situation must be torture for the
girl, as for himself or any normal person
of their civilization.</p>

<p>Cursing himself for an optimist, he
raised two more of the missiles from
the magazine. Hopping about like a
jet-checker five minutes before take-off
time, he made them ready. It
seemed like hours before he got them
into the launching tubes and blew
them out into the void.</p>

<p>Again, he watched the other vessel
appear ahead of his torpedoes, this
time on both screens. Before the gap
narrowed, he had a better opportunity
to see the defenses of the cruiser in
action.</p>

<p>A whitish cloud of gas was expelled
from his target's hull, bearing a myriad
of small objects which promptly
acquired a life of their own. Both
screens were filled with flashing, diverging
trails of flame. Then&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"They're heading at us!" called
Donna. "Hang on!"</p>

<p>Phillips had already pulled the
switches to bring up a new pair of
torpedoes. Hearing the urgency in
Donna's tone, he leaped toward a
rack of spacesuits and grabbed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The next instant, he</span>
was pinned forcibly against the
rack by acceleration, as Donna made
the ship dodge aside. From one side,
he heard a screech of grating metal.
The fresh missiles must have jammed
halfway out of the storage compartment.</p>

<p>It gave him a weird feeling of unreality;
as he hung there helplessly,
to see one of the screens on the bulkhead
pick up something moving,
gleaming, metallic.</p>

<p>"Donna!" he shouted hoarsely. "Let
up!"</p>

<p>"I don't dare," she gasped over the
intercom. "I lost them, but they were
starting after us!"</p>

<p>"Let up!" repeated Phillips.
"They're dead ahead of that wild shot
of ours. Let me get to the controls!"</p>

<p>He dropped abruptly to the deck as
the acceleration vanished. One leap
carried him to the radio controls.</p>

<p>The metallic gleam had swelled into
a huge spaceship. The cruiser was
angling slightly away from the point
from which he seemed to be viewing
it. How soon, he wondered, would
they detect the presence of his torpedo?
Or would they neglect this direction,
being intent upon the destruction
of those who were attempting to
frustrate their mad dash for Mars?</p>

<p>Phillips stood before the screen,
clenching his fists. There was, after
all, nothing for him to do but watch.
The gleaming hull expanded with a
swelling rush. Details of construction,
hitherto invisible, leaped out at him.
A crack finally appeared as a section
began to slide back.</p>

<p>This time, however, there was no
blinding flare of small rockets. The
blacking out of the screen coincided
with Donna's scream. "<i>It hit!</i>"</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, he
thought he heard a sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, Phillips," she said, recovering,
"we did it. They're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hang on," said Phillips. "I'll climb
into a spacesuit and come forward."</p>

<p>He switched off the intercom and
dragged a suit from the rack. It took
him a good fifteen minutes to get the
helmet screwed on properly and to
check everything else. He realized that
he was very tired.</p>

<p>He opened the exit hatch, seized
the top of the ladder in his gauntlets
as the air exploded out of the turret,
and climbed back to the main deck.</p>

<p>Clumping forward through the airless
corridor, he stopped to look into
the compartment where he had left
Brecken. He quickly slid the door shut
again.</p>

<p>He found that Donna had sealed
off the corridor just short of the control
room by closing a double emergency
door that must have been designed
to form an airlock in just such
a situation. He hammered upon it, and
she slid it open from the control desk.</p>

<p>It closed again behind him, and he
entered the control room through the
usual door. The girl helped him to
remove the suit and motioned him toward
the screen.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Phillips regarded the</span>
scene without enthusiasm. The
sight of the dead man had reminded
him of what the compartments of that
other vessel must look like by now.
Its parts were beginning to scatter
slowly.</p>

<p>He looked at Donna, and found her
regarding him soberly. "What will
they do with us now?" she asked.</p>

<p>She looked exhausted. He extended
an arm, and she leaned against him.
"You heard what Varret said," he told
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, but will he keep his word?
They might be ... ashamed of us, now
that it's done. Even if they're not, I
can't bear the thought of going back
to Earth and having them stare at
me!"</p>

<p>Phillips nodded. He remembered the
morbid curiosity during his own trial,
the crowds who had watched him with
a kind of shrinking horror&mdash;and he
had actually been responsible for saving
a spaceship and its crew, had they
cared to look on that side of the affair.</p>

<p>But he had killed. That was no
longer the action of a normal human
being, according to popular thinking.</p>

<p>"I guess you and I are the only
ones who will understand one another
from now on," he shrugged.</p>

<p>Donna smiled faintly, just as the
signal sounded on the communication
screen.</p>

<p>It was Varret, looking pale and
strained. He listened to Phillips' account,
including the deaths of Truesdale
and Brecken, and apologized for
his appearance. He had, he informed
them, been unpleasantly ill when he
had seen the explosion. "It was a terrible
thing," Varret continued sadly,
"but necessary. They were beyond
reasoning with, and a deadly menace."</p>

<p>He pulled himself together and tried
to hide his agitation by reminding
them of his promise. He suggested
that they consider their requests while
his ship attempted to tow them in to
Deimos.</p>

<p>Phillips glanced speculatively at
Donna. They would be two outcasts,
however much their deed might be
respected abstractly, however much official
expressions of gratitude were
employed to gloss over the fact. He
might as well take one chance more.
"We have already decided," he said
boldly. "I hear you are building a new
space station on Deimos."</p>

<p>The old man nodded, surprised.</p>

<p>"We will ask for a deed to that
moon, and a contract to operate the
beacon and radio relay station," Phillips
stated flatly.</p>

<p>Varret blinked, then smiled slightly
in a sort of understanding admiration.</p>

<p>"Reasonable and astute," he murmured
after a moment's hesitation.
"I think I appreciate the motive. Perhaps,
if that ship can be repaired and
remodeled, we can include it so that
you may make short visits to Mars."</p>

<p>He warned them to watch for the
emergency crew he would send to their
aid, and switched off.</p>

<p>Phillips then dared finally to turn
and look inquiringly at Donna. Her
smile was relaxed for the first time
since they had met. "Nice bargaining,"
she said, and Phillips felt like
the king of something larger than a
tiny Martian satellite.</p>
